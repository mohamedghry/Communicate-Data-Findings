## by Mohamed Algohary


## Dataset

This data is from Ford GoBike System for the month of February 2019. The data set consisted of 183,412 observations (*rows*) and 16 features (*columns*).

The features are time and location information for both start and end of each trip. The last main section of the features is information about the users including birth year, gender, and user type.


## Summary of Findings

Based on the available data, the following observations were found:

- 91% of the users are subscribers, while 9% are not.
- The gender distribution of the data is 75% males, 23% females, and 2% other.
- Younger users, mainly users in their 30s followed by those in their 20s, are the majority of the service users.
- The use of the service peaks mainly at 8 AM and 5 PM, namely rush hours. This is due to work times of most businesses in the United States.
- The busiest days of week in regards of service use is during midweeks from Tuesday to Thursday, while weekends witness the lowest use of service.
- The majority of service (bike rides) take 20 minutes or less.
- The age of the user does not seem to affect whether the user is a subscriber or not.
- Male users have the highest proportion of subscribers.
